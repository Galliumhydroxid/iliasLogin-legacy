## UPDATE: I am not studying at KIT anymore, and they have deleted my KIT account, therefore I can't maintain it anymore. I've heard there's a new Ilias version and I expect that it will at least partially break my extension. Feel free to create/publish your own version, the code is really simple to adapt.

# Ilias Login

This is a repository for a **firefox** addon which clicks you through the ilias and campus pages automatically. It is meant to be used by people studying at KIT University in Karlsruhe Germany. You need to have your password saved by the firefox password manager.

## How to use:

Firefox addon Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/iliaslogin/

## Wanna help?

You are welcome to make a push request. But if you prefer you can also just fork it, I do not mind at all.
